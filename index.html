    <h3> <a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The user interface in games is one of the most crucial part of a player’s experience. It’s one of the biggest fundamental experiences. It allows us to start, load, change difficulty, optimise and exit the game but that’s just the start it also shows us what to do and where to go in game, provides tutorials when needed and guides when important. Without these options we would be left in the deep of the game with no idea where to start. In this document I will explore and evaluate an existing UI along with receiving feedback from other players in the industry, I will also create a questionnaire related to the UI of that particular game and evaluate the feedback people have given to me. <br>
        </p>
    <h3> <a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Game</h3>
        <p>The game I will be reviewing is The Last of Us, winner of 11 awards including 4 BAFTA’s. it’s very apparent that this game deserves the recognition it got but its UI was not evaluated as much as it should have been. </p>
    <h3> <a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>I will evaluate in a three-part order from the first piece of UI you see being the main menu the second being gameplay and the third being micro-managment features like Inventory UI. The research &amp; evaluation is conducted through the Qualitative &amp; Quantative Method where I would research UI and find deeper meaning between them while finding weaknesses and strength in them, also providing ways on improving certain features. I will also list some design heuristics that are used within the UI of the game.<br>
        </p>
    <h3> <a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Main Menu</h3>
<iframe width="610" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7MaaVHwdRM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This is the first piece of UI you see, it has an animated background of a broken down window with overgrown ivy searing through where the glass would b, all interactive menu selections would be shown on the left of the window. This menu is aesthetically pleasing to the player, in my questionnaire conducted on SurveyMonkey I asked users “Was the animated background necessary for the menu?” &amp; 57.14% of people voted “I think it was an aesthetic merit to the menu” while 42.86% said “I liked the animation, it was relevant to the games setting”. This goes to show that it did nothing but add apparel to the menu but no one thought it was unnecessary, having animated background in the menu has been around for long periods of time, even other AAA titles like the portal franchise had animated main menu but these two have one thing in common both menus are captivating because they are relevant to the games setting. Upon pressing Start, some other options appear, and it gives you a simplistic amount of selections, right off the bat it gives you story selection, The Last of Us (Main Story) and Left Behind (DLC Story); while some games give you an option for DLC Selection like Witcher 3; this game does not, and I suppose this is an easier way due to the lack of DLC &amp; it’s easier to access directly from the start menu. As you can see below it gives you a description of the DLC before you play it, this applies to all selections, I like this feature because if or when you are in the options you are able to understand what certain features do like the 30fps Lock in the Remastered Version of the game, however this is also an issue because the text itself looks like its badly positioned and out of place &amp; sometimes not very clear to see. I asked in the survey “How did you find the input latency navigating through the User Interface” &amp; while no one thought it was sluggish 14.29% of people voted “The Input latency felt a bit slow” and 57.14% Voted “The input latency felt fine” &amp; 28.7% felt the latency was fast. I personally felt the input latency was satisfactory but it could have been improved. Slow latency could be caused by a number of things but a AAA company releasing a AAA game should have no excuse for slow input latency. <br>
    </p>
<h3> <a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gameplay UI</h3>
        <p>This is what the player will be seeing most of the time spent during gameplay. A simplistic HUD, consisting of a crosshair (Depends on weapon type), a selected weapon (icon), available melee weapon (icon), ammo information for primary, toolkit selected in this case a crowbar &amp; finally health bar. The Inventory is brought up via button press (Triangle). The main character in this case Joel will be interrupted &amp; will crouch and pull out his backpack imitating pulling out his actual inventory. This clever UI implementation adds a sense of realism to the game, with that realism adds game mechanics like take cover to browse your inventory and aid yourself in combat. The UI has a mechanic as part of a field of view where items are only highlighted when in Joel’s peripheral vision, this feature like the inventory adds a sense of realism to the game. The realism being that unlike some games where it would highlight loot from a distance this game only allows you to see what you should be able to notice. <br>
        </p>
    <h3> <a id="designer-templates2" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simplicity</h3>
        <p>This UI makes use of one design heuristic the most, aesthetic &amp; minimalist design. This is the Heuristic where dialog and information should not be shown when unnecessary because if shown too much each piece of information is indivertibly competing for the user’s attention; but that’s not the only way this game uses this heuristic, it uses it in such a way that it makes use of other mechanics. When facing a survival game like this where it is driven by mechanics and narrative, realism is something developers would want to take seriously. I believe NaughtyDog the developers of this game took that into consideration when in development, they understood that with all the cutscenes, gameplay and dialog they didn’t want anything unnecessary to distract the user from their narrative and captivating mechanics. <br>
        </p>
<h3> <a id="designer-templates3" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Reaserch Conducted (Quantitative)</h3>
        <p>The research I mainly conducted was through surveys, I thought the best way to get information from players for a game would be through questionnaires consisting of multiple choice questions, simple, right? I came to find out that that was not the case, constructing a survey is very difficult so I decided to do a little more research on it. I came to find out about something called the “Likert” scale. The figure below is an example to a question given to someone, they would vote and tick according to their decision and/or feeling to a question. <br>
        </p>
<img src="images/Figure 1.jpg" width="536" height="167" alt=""/>
<p>But some of my questions were vague and slightly bias, not via the question itself but how I phrased the question, an example would be I did not offer an undecided choice for those who were actually undecided. So what I did was follow some guidelines on the Likert scare from SurveyMonkey. It taught me 3 simple tips and best practices of which I used most. <br>
  <br>
  <strong> Keep it labelled</strong> – This told me to number scales 1-5 for example for ratings or even use words like “Poor” to “Excellent”. It’s the practice that enables the respondents to give the closest viable answer according to them. <br>
  <strong>Keep it unipolar</strong> – This is the practice that keeps the selections clear. Rather than using answers like “Extremely good” to “Extremely bad” one would label answers like “Not at all” to “Very good” this enables the respondent to be more sure of their answer. <br>
  <strong> Keep it odd</strong> – While I did not use this practice much it was still a tip I followed, it’s the practice that you should always label with odd numbers e.g. 1-7, reason why one would follow this practice is because odd numbers have a midpoint and when a respondent is given a midpoint they are comfortable with giving a not sure answer of which they are torn between. <br>

<h3> <a id="designer-templates4" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Heuristics Used (Qualitative)</h3>
<p>I followed JAKOB NIELSEN’S 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design and applied it to see if the Last of Us made use of them. All heuristic research was done primarily exploratory. I wanted to get a deeper understanding of some UI features. This shows that it is qualitative research. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Visibility of system status</strong> – This is the heuristic of which the user should always be informed about what is going on on-screen. In the last of us the user is always informed as to what is going on with the player, when Joel (The main character) is hit by a bullet the screen will flash a darker dimmer tone and slight blood effects will show on screen as well as your health bar being lowered. But not only that the game also gives you tips occasionally. See figure below. <br>
</p>
<img src="images/Joel hit.png" alt="" width="644" height="364"/>
<p><br>
  <strong>Match between system and real world</strong> – This heuristic is about the user interface speaking in terms the user can understand; it applies to this game because as you can see in the figure above it will show you buttons to press when needed. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>User control and freedom</strong> – This is the heuristic of which the user can make mistakes and would like the control in order to correct those mistakes, this is not really applied to the last of us since there is an auto save feature, this means every progress the player has made it will create a save point. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Consistency and standards</strong> – This is the heuristic of which the user should not have to be concerned if certain actions do the same thing; this is not really applied either since there are conventions in console games in UI, in shooter games for example the user will be prompted with (Square) being the reload button &amp; the Last of us follows those conventions to an extent.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Error prevention</strong> – This is the heuristic of which the player must be prompted with error messages of sorts before they are to take an action. The Last of Us UI does not really have prompts for error but rather makes it clear to press a button before you make an action, for example you would be prompted press triangle to open a door once you approach it; this gives the player/user a sense of control. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Recognition rather than recall</strong> – This is the heuristic of which a user interface has to minimise the player’s memory use by making objects, actions and options visible, as you can see in the figure above the user is shown what to do in a situation when they are getting attacked, this is a great example of recognition rather than recall because given the intense sit<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use</strong> - This is the heuristic of which the UI should cater for both experienced and novice users; the last of us does not make use of this heuristic, it treats all users as if they were new to the game, I would have liked to see an option prompted to the user to skip tutorials and not be shown tool tips for the experienced player. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong> – See Simplicity above. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors</strong> – This is the heuristic of which the user should be explained in simple terms what is wrong in an error, this is used in the last of us when overwriting an automatic save game, it will prompt you with “are you sure you want to overwrite this save game” this is helping the user understand that they already have a save game and they do have the option to create a new save should they want. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Help and documentation</strong> – This is the heuristic of which the user should be given help and documentation on features they might not understand. This is discussed in Main Menu UI above. When the user is in game it will give you tool tips like shown in the figure above. In the menu it has a darkened description of each button and selectable menu option. <br>
