    <h3> <a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The user interface in games is one of the most crucial part of a player’s experience. It’s one of the biggest fundamental experiences. It allows us to start, load, change difficulty, optimise and exit the game but that’s just the start it also shows us what to do and where to go in game, provides tutorials when needed and guides when important. Without these options we would be left in the deep of the game with no idea where to start. In this document I will explore and evaluate an existing UI along with receiving feedback from other players in the industry, I will also create a questionnaire related to the UI of that particular game and evaluate the feedback people have given to me. <br>
        </p>
    <h3> <a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Game</h3>
        <p>The game I will be reviewing is The Last of Us, winner of 11 awards including 4 BAFTA’s. it’s very apparent that this game deserves the recognition it got but its UI was not evaluated as much as it should have been. </p>
    <h3> <a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>I will evaluate in a three-part order from the first piece of UI you see being the main menu the second being gameplay and the third being micro-managment features like Inventory UI. The research &amp; evaluation is conducted through the Qualitative &amp; Quantative Method where I would research UI and find deeper meaning between them while finding weaknesses and strength in them, also providing ways on improving certain features. I will also list some design heuristics that are used within the UI of the game.<br>
        </p>
    <h3> <a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Main Menu</h3>
<iframe width="610" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7MaaVHwdRM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This is the first piece of UI you see, it has an animated background of a broken down window with overgrown ivy searing through where the glass would b, all interactive menu selections would be shown on the left of the window. This menu is aesthetically pleasing to the player, in my questionnaire conducted on SurveyMonkey I asked users “Was the animated background necessary for the menu?” &amp; 57.14% of people voted “I think it was an aesthetic merit to the menu” while 42.86% said “I liked the animation, it was relevant to the games setting”. This goes to show that it did nothing but add apparel to the menu but no one thought it was unnecessary, having animated background in the menu has been around for long periods of time, even other AAA titles like the portal franchise had animated main menu but these two have one thing in common both menus are captivating because they are relevant to the games setting. Upon pressing Start, some other options appear, and it gives you a simplistic amount of selections, right off the bat it gives you story selection, The Last of Us (Main Story) and Left Behind (DLC Story); while some games give you an option for DLC Selection like Witcher 3; this game does not, and I suppose this is an easier way due to the lack of DLC &amp; it’s easier to access directly from the start menu. As you can see below it gives you a description of the DLC before you play it, this applies to all selections, I like this feature because if or when you are in the options you are able to understand what certain features do like the 30fps Lock in the Remastered Version of the game, however this is also an issue because the text itself looks like its badly positioned and out of place &amp; sometimes not very clear to see. I asked in the survey “How did you find the input latency navigating through the User Interface” &amp; while no one thought it was sluggish 14.29% of people voted “The Input latency felt a bit slow” and 57.14% Voted “The input latency felt fine” &amp; 28.7% felt the latency was fast. I personally felt the input latency was satisfactory but it could have been improved. Slow latency could be caused by a number of things but a AAA company releasing a AAA game should have no excuse for slow input latency. <br>
    </p>
<h3> <a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gameplay UI</h3>
        <p>This is what the player will be seeing most of the time spent during gameplay. A simplistic HUD, consisting of a crosshair (Depends on weapon type), a selected weapon (icon), available melee weapon (icon), ammo information for primary, toolkit selected in this case a crowbar &amp; finally health bar. The Inventory is brought up via button press (Triangle). The main character in this case Joel will be interrupted &amp; will crouch and pull out his backpack imitating pulling out his actual inventory. This clever UI implementation adds a sense of realism to the game, with that realism adds game mechanics like take cover to browse your inventory and aid yourself in combat. The UI has a mechanic as part of a field of view where items are only highlighted when in Joel’s peripheral vision, this feature like the inventory adds a sense of realism to the game. The realism being that unlike some games where it would highlight loot from a distance this game only allows you to see what you should be able to notice. <br>
        </p>
    <h3> <a id="designer-templates2" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simplicity</h3>
        <p>This UI makes use of one design heuristic the most, aesthetic &amp; minimalist design. This is the Heuristic where dialog and information should not be shown when unnecessary because if shown too much each piece of information is indivertibly competing for the user’s attention; but that’s not the only way this game uses this heuristic, it uses it in such a way that it makes use of other mechanics. When facing a survival game like this where it is driven by mechanics and narrative, realism is something developers would want to take seriously. I believe NaughtyDog the developers of this game took that into consideration when in development, they understood that with all the cutscenes, gameplay and dialog they didn’t want anything unnecessary to distract the user from their narrative and captivating mechanics. <br>
